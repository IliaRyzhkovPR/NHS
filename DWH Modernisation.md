# NHS Data Warehouse Modernisation and Inner Source Adoption: A Strategic Guide

## Abstract

Many NHS Trusts are facing critical junctures in their data management strategies. Legacy data warehouses (DWHs), while functional, often struggle with scalability issues and are tightly coupled with existing data sources. Additionally, IT and Business Intelligence (BI) processes often face bottlenecks due to high demand and limited resources. This paper outlines common challenges faced by NHS Trusts in their data management, identifies key issues, and presents requirements for future-proof solutions. It explores options for modernising data warehouses, comparing on-premises and cloud-based approaches, and introduces the concept of Inner Source as a means to streamline IT and BI processes. This comprehensive guide aims to provide direction for NHS organisations looking to enhance their data analytics capabilities and foster a more collaborative data environment.

## 1. Introduction

NHS Trusts increasingly rely on data-driven insights to improve patient care, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making. However, many Trusts are grappling with outdated data warehouse systems that are struggling to meet current demands. Additionally, the traditional siloed approach to IT and BI processes often leads to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges, potential solutions, and strategic considerations for NHS Trusts embarking on data warehouse modernisation projects and adopting more collaborative approaches to data management.

## 2. Current State and Common Challenges

Many NHS Trusts face similar challenges with their existing data warehouse systems and IT/BI processes:

1. Tight coupling with source systems
2. Multiple, separate DWHs for different data sources
3. Lack of layer separation in data architecture
4. Inefficient data movement processes
5. Absence of a Master Data Patient Index
6. Dependencies on physical hardware for data extraction
7. Limited processing windows for certain data sources
8. Delays in data availability
9. Inefficiencies in the Data Mart layer
10. Manual recalculation of indicators and metrics
11. Low data transfer speeds
12. Limited data sharing capabilities
13. Severe bottlenecks in BI teams due to high demand and limited resources
14. Lack of transparency in data processes
15. Limited ability for analysts and other stakeholders to contribute to data solutions
16. Inefficient workarounds becoming permanent
17. Difficulty in scaling current processes to meet growing data needs

These challenges often result in decreased operational efficiency, limited scalability, and difficulties in adapting to changing healthcare data needs.

## 3. Requirements for Modernised Data Warehouse Systems

To address these challenges, modernised NHS data warehouse systems should aim to meet the following requirements:

1. System-agnostic data model based on business processes
2. Transparent design with clear algorithms and processes
3. Proper layer separation to prevent performance issues
4. Code-based data movement for improved transparency
5. Robust patient identification algorithms
6. Resilient and automated data extraction processes
7. Frequent data updates, ideally near real-time
8. Support for live data streaming where possible
9. Single version of truth for calculations and metrics
10. Optimised reporting layer with common datasets
11. Improved data transfer speeds
12. Enhanced data sharing capabilities
13. Collaborative environment allowing contributions from various stakeholders
14. Version control and code review processes
15. Self-service data preparation capabilities
16. Automated testing and deployment
17. Comprehensive documentation and knowledge sharing

## 4. Design Considerations: On-Premises vs. Cloud

When considering modernisation options, NHS Trusts typically face a choice between upgrading their on-premises systems or migrating to cloud-based solutions. Both approaches have their merits and considerations:

### 4.1 On-Premises Design

An on-premises solution typically requires:

1. New or upgraded hardware for data landing and processing
2. Virtualisation of key components for improved resilience
3. Separation of data layers, potentially across different servers
4. Implementation of code-based data movement
5. Upgrades to network infrastructure for improved data transfer speeds

### 4.2 Cloud-Based Design

A cloud-based solution offers several advantages:

1. Data lake architecture for improved data management
2. Potentially faster data transfer and near real-time reporting
3. Simplified delta identification through cloud-native tools
4. Natural layer separation and integration
5. Flexible cost management through adjustable resource allocation
6. Access to advanced cloud-native services for analytics and AI

## 5. Inner Source Solution for Streamlining IT and BI Processes

To address the challenges related to collaboration and process efficiency, NHS Trusts should consider implementing an Inner Source solution. This approach applies open-source principles within the organization, fostering collaboration while maintaining necessary governance structures.

### 5.1 Core Principles of Inner Source

1. Transparency: All processes and code visible to authorised personnel
2. Collaboration: Enable contributions from BI teams, analysts, and other appropriately trained stakeholders
3. Governance: Maintain BI team's gatekeeping function for quality control
4. Flexibility: Adaptable to changing needs and technologies
5. System Agnostic: Designed to work with current on-premises infrastructure and future cloud environments

### 5.2 Key Components of an Inner Source Platform

1. Centralised Code Repository (e.g., GitHub Enterprise)
2. Self-Service Data Preparation Tools (e.g., dbt for SQL-based transformations)
3. Automated Testing and Deployment (CI/CD pipelines)
4. Integrated Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
5. Streamlined Software Management

## 6. Implementation Strategy

A phased implementation strategy is recommended for both data warehouse modernisation and Inner Source adoption:

1. Start with a proof of concept focusing on key datasets
2. Design and implement necessary infrastructure
3. Set up the central code repository and define access controls
4. Migrate existing ETL processes and scripts to the new platform
5. Implement automated testing and deployment pipelines
6. Provide training to BI teams and analysts on the new tools and processes
7. Gradually onboard analysts and other stakeholders to contribute
8. Establish governance processes for code review and approval
9. Continuously evaluate and optimise the new system
10. Plan and execute phased migration to cloud infrastructure, if applicable

## 7. Benefits

1. Reduced bottlenecks in data preparation and analysis
2. Increased transparency and trust in data processes
3. Empowerment of analysts to contribute directly to data solutions
4. Improved collaboration between BI teams and downstream users
5. Faster turnaround times for new data requests
6. Better documentation and knowledge sharing
7. Scalable solution that can grow with the Trust's needs
8. Gradual skill development for cloud technologies
9. Improved data quality through automated testing and reviews
10. Enhanced ability to adapt to changing healthcare data needs

## 8. Potential Challenges and Mitigations

1. Resistance to change: Address through comprehensive training and clear communication of benefits
2. Quality control concerns: Implement robust code review processes and maintain BI team oversight
3. Security considerations: Work closely with IT to ensure all tools meet security requirements
4. Skills gap: Provide ongoing training and support for new tools and processes
5. Cloud migration complexity: Adopt a phased approach with continuous training and support
6. Initial productivity dip: Plan for a temporary decrease in productivity during the transition period

## 9. Conclusion

Modernising data warehouse systems and adopting Inner Source principles are critical steps for NHS Trusts looking to enhance their data analytics capabilities and streamline IT and BI processes. While the journey may present challenges, the potential benefits in terms of improved data management, enhanced decision-making, increased operational efficiency, and fostered collaboration make it a worthwhile endeavour.

By carefully considering their specific needs, evaluating both on-premises and cloud options, and adopting a strategic, phased approach to implementation, NHS Trusts can successfully navigate the path to a modern, robust data warehouse solution and a more collaborative data environment. This approach not only supports their mission of providing excellent patient care but also positions them to better leverage their data assets in an increasingly data-driven healthcare landscape.
